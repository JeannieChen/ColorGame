A JS/HTML/CSS project in the Web Developer class offered by Udemy. The user is given a rgb value randomly each time and is tasked with finding the color that matches that value. If the wrong color is selected, it is removed from the options. When the correct color is chosen, the screen will change to that color and a message will be displayed.

There are 2 modes that can be selected. "Easy" will give the user 3 colors to choose from, while "Hard" will have 6 different colors. User can restart the game anytime.
